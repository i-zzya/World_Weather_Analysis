# World_Weather_Analysis

After developing an app that helps plan trips we've been asked to make some upgrades so ofcourse we're all ears. It was recommended that we add the weather description so that users can filter specifically to their weather preferences. This would help narrow down ideal travel destinations and hotels nearby. We asked beta testers to choose 4 cities to create an travel itinerary and a marker layer map between them.
